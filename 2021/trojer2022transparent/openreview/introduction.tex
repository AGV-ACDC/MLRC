\section{Introduction}
In recent years, the tracking community has made amazing progress. Many new tracking methods, particularly neural network trackers, have substantially improved the tracking of opaque objects. Existing research in the topic mostly focuses on tracking of opaque objects, with very little attention dedicated to tracking of transparent objects. However, transparency brings additional challenges not well tackled by the state-of-the-art in opaque object tracking.

Tracking of such objects may be very relevant to robotic vision, human-machine interaction and security surveillance. A vessel collecting plastic from the sea, for example, could so effectively track plastic in the sea and remove it from the water. Another potential application is the grabbing of produced light bulbs with a robotic arm.

That is why it is important to reproduce and verify the results of this article, as it proposes a new state-of-the-art tracker TransAtom, which is currently thought to be the best performing when tracking transparent objects compared to other trackers.
