\section{Scope of reproducibility}
\label{sec:claims}

In our work, we focused on reproducing and comparing the results of various trackers on TOTB. The proposed TOTB - transparent object tracking benchmark, which is the first benchmark dedicated to transparent object tracking, was the original paper's main contribution. In our opinion, this is a significant contribution because it is the first step toward the development of trackers for transparent objects. 

We intended to evaluate and compare the proposed TransATOM tracker to other state-of-the-art trackers on the aforementioned dataset. With this, we hoped to validate the claim that TransATOM significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art trackers designed primarily for tracking opaque objects. We hoped to verify the claim that including a transparency feature in the tracker improves performance when tracking transparent objects. Finally, we conducted a qualitative evaluation on various types of recordings to see where different trackers excel and where they fail.


Claims that we tested are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item TransATOM assessed on TOTB significantly outperforms other evaluated state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin.
    \item Including a transparency feature in the tracker improves performance when tracking transparent objects.
    \item TransATOM well handles all challenges  for robust target localization owing to the transparency features.
\end{itemize}
