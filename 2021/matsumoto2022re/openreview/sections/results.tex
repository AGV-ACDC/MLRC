\paragraph{Relative error and residual norms of singular triplets}

The relative error and residual norm of the leading $k=50$ singular triplets for the CRAN dataset at $\phi=1,5,10$ using Algorithms 2.1, 2.2, and \verb|FrequentDirections| are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cran_relerr_resnorm}.
Due to the large number of figures, the complete set of plots for the standard experiments are presented in Sections A to E in the Supplementary Materials.
When comparing the relative error and residual norm plots for Algorithm 2.1 on CRAN, CISI, and MED, our results matched those of \cite{Kalantzis2021} exactly.
For Algorithm 2.2, the plots did not match exactly, though the differences never exceeded half an order of magnitude and are attributable to the randomness inherent in Algorithm 2.2.

Our comparison of the relative error and residual norm of the $k=50$-th singular triplet for Algorithm 2.2 with various values of $r$ revealed a similar result to \cite{Kalantzis2021} â€“ across the three methods, Algorithm 2.2 had the lowest errors, and within variations of Algorithm 2.2, larger values of $r$ yielded higher accuracy.

\paragraph{Runtime}

For all three of the datasets which we measured runtimes on, we found Algorithm 2.2 to require a substantially longer amount of time to complete all of its updates.
Algorithm 2.1 and \verb|FrequentDirections| required a similar length of time, though Algorithm 2.1 was consistently faster than \verb|FrequentDirections| by a small margin.
The runtime plots for the standard experiments are shown in Section F of the Supplementary Materials.

\paragraph{Number of batches and rank} 

Due to space-related constraints, we chose to only include two examples from the array of plots generated (Figure \ref{fig:cran_variations}).
Despite the large variation in the parameters, we can see that the residual norm for overlapping update numbers and $k$ share very similar values.
