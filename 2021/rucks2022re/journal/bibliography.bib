	abstract = {Phase problems occur in many scientific disciplines, particularly those involving remote sensing using a wave field. Although there has been much interest in phase retrieval in optics and in imaging in general over the past decade, phase retrieval has a much longer history in x-ray crystallography, and a variety of powerful and practical techniques have been developed. The nature of crystallography means that crystallographic phase problems are distinct from those in other imaging contexts, but there are a number of commonalities. Here the principles of phase retrieval in crystallography are outlined and are compared and contrasted with phase retrieval in general imaging. Uniqueness results are discussed, but the emphasis is on phase-retrieval algorithms and areas in which results in one discipline have, and may, contribute to the other.},

	abstract = {Iterative algorithms for phase retrieval from intensity data are compared to gradient search methods. Both the problem of phase retrieval from two intensity measurements (in electron microscopy or wave front sensing) and the problem of phase retrieval from a single intensity measurement plus a non-negativity constraint (in astronomy) are considered, with emphasis on the latter. It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge. The error-reduction algorithm is also shown to be closely related to the steepest-descent method. Other algorithms, including the input--output algorithm and the conjugate-gradient method, are shown to converge in practice much faster than the error-reduction algorithm. Examples are shown.},
