        abstract = {Rideshare and ride-pooling platforms use artiﬁcial intelligence-based matching algorithms to pair riders and drivers. However, these platforms can induce inequality either through an unequal income distribution or disparate treatment of riders. We investigate two methods to reduce forms of inequality in ride-pooling platforms: (1) incorporating fairness constraints into the objective function and (2) redistributing income to drivers to reduce income ﬂuctuation and inequality. To evaluate our solutions, we use the New York City taxi data set. For the ﬁrst method, we ﬁnd that optimizing for driverside fairness outperforms state-of-the-art models on the number of riders serviced, both in the worst-off neighborhood and overall, showing that optimizing for fairness can assist proﬁtability in certain circumstances. For the second method, we explore income redistribution as a way to combat income inequality by having drivers keep an r fraction of their income, and contributing the rest to a redistribution pool. For certain values of r, most drivers earn near their Shapley value, while still incentivizing drivers to maximize value, thereby avoiding the free-rider problem and reducing income variability. The ﬁrst method can be extended to many deﬁnitions of fairness and the second method provably improves fairness without affecting proﬁtability.},

        abstract = {On-demand ride-pooling (e.g., {UberPool}, {LyftLine}, {GrabShare}) has recently become popular because of its ability to lower costs for passengers while simultaneously increasing revenue for drivers and aggregation companies (e.g., Uber). Unlike in Taxi on Demand ({ToD}) services – where a vehicle is assigned one passenger at a time – in on-demand ridepooling, each (possibly partially ﬁlled) vehicle must be assigned a group of passenger requests with multiple different origin and destination pairs in such a way that quality constraints are not violated. To ensure near real-time response, existing solutions to the real-time ride-pooling problem are myopic in that they optimise the objective (e.g., maximise the number of passengers served) for the current time step without considering the effect such an assignment could have on feasible assignments in future time steps. However, considering the future effects of an assignment that already has to consider what combinations of passenger requests can be assigned to vehicles adds an extra layer of combinatorial complexity on top of the already challenging problem of considering future effects in the {ToD} case.},

        abstract = {Taxi services are a vital part of urban transportation, and a considerable contributor to traffic congestion and air pollution causing substantial adverse effects on human health. Sharing taxi trips is a possible way of reducing the negative impact of taxi services on cities, but this comes at the expense of passenger discomfort quantifiable in terms of a longer travel time. Due to computational challenges, taxi sharing has traditionally been approached on small scales, such as within airport perimeters, or with dynamical ad-hoc heuristics. However, a mathematical framework for the systematic understanding of the tradeoff between collective benefits of sharing and individual passenger discomfort is lacking. Here we introduce the notion of shareability network which allows us to model the collective benefits of sharing as a function of passenger inconvenience, and to efficiently compute optimal sharing strategies on massive datasets. We apply this framework to a dataset of millions of taxi trips taken in New York City, showing that with increasing but still relatively low passenger discomfort, cumulative trip length can be cut by 40\% or more. This benefit comes with reductions in service cost, emissions, and with split fares, hinting towards a wide passenger acceptance of such a shared service. Simulation of a realistic online system demonstrates the feasibility of a shareable taxi service in New York City. Shareability as a function of trip density saturates fast, suggesting effectiveness of the taxi sharing system also in cities with much sparser taxi fleets or when willingness to share is low.},
