abstract: "This report summarizes our efforts to reproduce the results presented in the ACL2021 paper Hate Speech Detection based on Sentiment Knowledge Sharing by Zhou et al., as part of the ML Reproducibility Challenge 2021. We attempt to verify the main claims of the original study by reproducing the experiments comparing models with and without sentiment knowledge sharing. Although the scores in our replication study matches with the ones reported in the original paper, our experiments result in substantially lower  scores for the full model with sentiment sharing. We also investigate variation in the scores, report additional scores (more suitable for the task), and discuss possible sources for the discrepancies reported."
