# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "Transformers have been an object of extensive research among deep generative models during the last few years. Precisely, they became a state-of-the-art model for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in 2017 and adopted the mechanism of attention, weighing the influence of different parts of the input data. In this project, we address the use of transformers in a different domain, computer vision, to perform weakly supervised semantic segmentation. Towards this goal, we combine classic back-propagation recipe through the chain rule with relevance propagation, another technique that is based on Deep Taylor Decomposition, to achieve significant performance, comparable to state-of-the-art CNN architectures, using transformers. Last but not least, we incorporate the concept of pixel affinities, which further improves performance in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU)."
