abstract: "In this work, the paper Strategic Classification Made Practical is evaluated through a reproduction study. We successfully reproduced the original resuls using the same dataset and hyperparameters. 
	   In addition, we conducted an additional experiment that tests the framework's performance a dataset containing both strategic and non-strategic users. The results show significant decrease in accuracy of linear models proportional to the number of non-strategic users.
 	   The non-linear RNN model achieves good performance regardless of the proportion of strategic users. The results provide insight into the limitations of the claims that the original approach is flexible and practical.
