abstract: "The Fifth Editon of Reproducibility Challenge, ML Reproducibility Challenge 2021, is an open, peer-reviewed, collaborative experiment in evaluating Replicability and Reproducibility of Machine Learning articles accepted at top ML conferences in 2021, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, CVPR, ICCV, AAAI and IJCAI. We conduct the challenge through Fall 2021 on accepted papers in these conferences, and in this special issue of ReScience journal we present the peer-reviewed selected reports."
