abstract: "This report covers our reproduction
effort of the paper ‘Differentiable Spatial Planning
using Transformers’ by
DOI Chaplot et al. [chaplot2021differentiable]. In this paper, the
problem of spatial path planning in a differentiable way is considered. They show that
their proposed method of using Spatial Planning Transformers outperforms prior data‐
driven models and leverages differentiable structures to learn mapping without a ground
truth map simultaneously. We verify these claims by reproducing their experiments
and testing their method on new data. We also investigate the stability of planning ac‐
curacy with maps with increased obstacle complexity. Efforts to investigate and verify
the learnings of the Mapper module were met with failure stemming from a paucity of
computational resources and unreachable authors."
