# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "We replicate Gao et. al. (2021), which proposes an automatic search
  algorithm to find privacy-preserving transformation policies to protect
  against gradient reconstruction attacks in a collaborative learning setting.
  All the main claims made by the authors were tested and most reported results
  were found to be reproducible. The exception is the correlation between a
  proposed privacy metric and reconstruction PSNR. We also extend the original
  experiments to a new dataset, and contribute a PyTorch Lightning framework to
  aid in future work."
